Currently a PhD candidate at Georgia Tech working in the [GRITS Lab](http://gritslab.gatech.edu/home/) with Dr. [Magnus Egerstedt](http://magnus.ece.gatech.edu/), my research is on *bio-physics inspired swarm robotics*, where I investigate how large teams of robots can use limited local interactions to perform useful tasks like localization, task allocation and density regulation. I use ideas from *statistical mechanics* and *biology* to model the physical encounters occurring among robots in a swarm. These models enable the development of decentralized algorithms which can be deployed on robots with very limited or no sensing at all. More information on my current and past projects can be found [here](research).

As a part of my Master's degree at Georgia Tech, I developed algorithms for robust autonomy in centralized multi-robot systems. My Bachelor's degree is from the Manipal Institute of Technology in Manipal, India. A more detailed chronology of my westward journey can be found [here](files/sid_mayya_cv.pdf).

Outside of the lab, I love spending time outdoors, be it hiking, playing tennis or challenging myself to a long run! I am passionate about traveling to new places and engaging in local traditions from different parts of the world.
