I am a PhD candidate at Georgia Tech working in the [GRITS Lab](http://gritslab.gatech.edu/home/) with Dr. [Magnus Egerstedt](http://magnus.ece.gatech.edu/). My research is focused on studying how large teams of robots can use extremely limited local interactions to perform useful tasks like localization, task allocation and density regulation. I use ideas from physics and biology to model the physical encounters occurring among robots in a swarm. The ultimate aim is to develop robust decentralized swarm robotic systems which can survive in the real world for long periods of time. More information on my current and past projects can be found [here](research).

I have a Master's degree from Georgia Tech during which I developed algorithms for robust autonomy in centralized multi-robot networks. I have a Bachelor's degree from the Manipal Institute of Technology in India.

Outside of the lab, I love spending time outdoors, be it hiking, playing tennis or challenging myself to a long run! I am passionate about traveling to new places, and engaging in local traditions from different parts of the world.
