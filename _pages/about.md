Hi! I am a PhD candidate working with Dr.Magnus Egerstedt at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, USA. My research as a part of the GRITS Lab, is focused on studying how large teams of robots can use extremely limited local interactions to perform useful tasks. Inspired by nature, the ultimate aim is to developed robust decentralized swarm robotic networks which can survive in the real world for long periods of time.

My work is inspired by insect colonies which demonstrate remarkable capabilities in situations where individuals use simple local encounters to infer something about the swarm and take appropriate actions.

I have a Master's degree from Georgia Tech during which I worked with Dr. Magnus Egerstedt on algorithms for robust autonomy in centralized mult-robot networks. I have a Bachelor's degree from the Manipal Institute of Technology in India.

I am in the process of updating the website. Please check back soon!
